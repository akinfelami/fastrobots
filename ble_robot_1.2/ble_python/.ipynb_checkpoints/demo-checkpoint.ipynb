    "__**NOTE**__: You may notice that the DEBUG message is not printed to the screen but is printed in the log file. This is because the logging level for the screen is set to INFO and for the file is set to DEBUG. You can change the default log levels in *utils.py* (**STREAM_LOG_LEVEL** and **FILE_LOG_LEVEL**). \n",
